	<p>The Land of Nod, a upscale three-tiered children's retailer and subsidiary of Crate & Barrel, carries with it a sense of humor, joy, and whimsy not found in many other places. In all facets of their digital and creative marketing, they strive for a voice and style that is unmatched, and impossible to recreate.</p>

<p>Their digital marketing—including email design, advertising, and social media—is often the first contact with the customer, and as such, bears the responsibility of communicating the brand in an informative yet engaging manor.</p>
