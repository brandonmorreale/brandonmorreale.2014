	<p>A design and build firm in Milwaukee came to Lightburn looking for a refresh on their current site.</p>
	<p>We took a long look at their assets and found their portfolio was ready for the spotlight. Using beautiful photography, customer feedback and their knack for truly selling their products we created full-featured and informative pages as well as a searchable and sortable project library. </p>
