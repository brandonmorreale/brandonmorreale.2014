	<p>The Land of Nod, a upscale three-tiered children's retailer and subsidiary of Crate & Barrel, carries with it a sense of humor, joy, and whimsy not found in many other places. In all facets of their digital and creative marketing, they strive for a voice and style that is unmatched, and impossible to recreate.</p>

<p>After a year-long branding endeavor and change in leadership we decided to bring some of that new whimsical voice to the web, designing and creating a new voices for their website and other digital properties.</p>
